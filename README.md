# youtube-extra-button-extension
 
## Description

Simple extension that allows to open **YouTube** video in `picture in picture` mode. 

**YouTube** doesn't have this feature by default so I decided to make one.

Official generic version made by **Google** that works on each website â€” [Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg)
